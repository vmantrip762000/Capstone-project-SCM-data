# Data Science for Supply Chain Analysis

All approaches explained in this repository aim to convey the underlying aspects of data science in supply chain practices of modern companies. 
Introduction section establishes need for data science and ongoing processes in supply chain that use data science. Background describes how supply chain management efficiency and functionality improves using data science methods and tools.
Methods section involves studying data science methods from the perspective of research paper, hands on analysis and case study of a real-life company “IKEA”. 
Towards the conclusion section, relevance of data science methods and techniques to solve real world supply chain problems is clearly conveyed and all the learnings in this essay are summarized briefly.

## Background
In the modern era of computers and automation, data science has found many applications in supply chain processes to automate computing, financial management, order planning and inventory control. 
Data anlysis helps to achieve ease of processing data and generating insights with increased speed of feedback. Domain knowledge and data science together help in faster improvements to the product life cycle.
